# LAMMS Project Development Summary

## Project Overview
LAMMS (Learning and Academic Management System) is a school management system that handles curricula, grades, sections, subjects, teachers, and student management. The application uses a Vue.js frontend with PrimeVue components and a Laravel PHP backend with a PostgreSQL database.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vue.js with Composition API
- **UI Library**: PrimeVue
- **State Management**: Combination of reactive Vue state and service modules
- **HTTP Client**: Axios configured with interceptors for error handling
- **Key Services**: 
  - CurriculumService
  - GradesService
  - TeacherService
  - SubjectService
  - SectionService

### Backend
- **Framework**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **API Design**: RESTful API with resource controllers
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum (Token-based)
- **Key Models**:
  - Curriculum
  - Grade
  - Section
  - Subject
  - Teacher
  - Student

## Key Features Implemented/Fixed

### Curriculum Management
- Create, read, update, delete curricula
- Manage curriculum status (Active, Draft, Archived)
- Associate grades with curricula through many-to-many relationship
- Fixed status mapping to align frontend values with database expectations
  - Changed 'Not Active' from 'Planned' to 'Draft'
  - Default new curricula to 'Draft' status
- Added proper error handling and logging

### Grade Level Management
- Create, read, update, delete grade levels
- Toggle grade active status
- Hierarchical organization with level field:
  - Kindergarten (level "0") 
  - Regular grades (levels "1"-"12")
  - ALS grades (levels "101" and up)
- Automatic level assignment based on grade code pattern:
  - "K1" → level "0"
  - "1" → level "1"
  - "ALS1" → level "101"
- Fixed the grades relationship in Curriculum model that had invalid pivots

### Section Management
- Associate sections with curriculum-grade combinations
- Manage section capacity and status
- Fixed section-grade relationships
- Fixed error handling for section operations

### UI Improvements
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Card-based interfaces for better UX
- Status indicators with color coding
- Implemented proper loading states

## Recent Fixes

### Fixed 500 Error in Curriculum-Grade Relationship
- Problem: API endpoint `/api/curriculums/1/grades` was returning 500 error
- Root cause: Curriculum model's grades relationship was trying to use a non-existent `display_order` column
- Fix: Removed the `withPivot('display_order')` from the relationship definition

### Fixed Import Issues
- Added missing `useToast` import in `src/views/pages/Admin/Curriculum.vue`

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added robust error handling in backend controllers with detailed logging
- Improved frontend error catching and display
- Added contextual error messages for different error types

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
1. `curricula` - Stores curriculum information (name, years, status)
2. `grades` - Stores grade levels (code, name, level, display_order)
3. `curriculum_grade` - Junction table for curriculum-grade relationships
4. `sections` - Stores section information (name, capacity, curriculum_id, grade_id)
5. `subjects` - Stores subject information (name, code, description)
6. `teachers` - Stores teacher information

### Key Relationships
- Curriculum ↔ Grades: Many-to-many through `curriculum_grade` table
- Grade → Sections: One-to-many
- Section → Subjects: Many-to-many with additional pivot data
- Teacher → Sections/Subjects: Various relationships for assignments

## Known Issues

### Curriculum Grade Addition - Persistent 422 Error
- **Issue**: When attempting to add a grade level to curriculum, the system shows "Kinder 2" in the dropdown despite it already being added to the curriculum
- **Error**: POST `/api/curriculums/1/grades` returns 422 (Unprocessable Content) with message "Grade is already added to this curriculum"
- **Root Cause**: Frontend filtering logic in `openAddGradeDialog()` is not properly preventing already-added grades from appearing in the dropdown
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Fixed `loadGradeLevels()` to use `curriculum.value.id` instead of `selectedCurriculum.value.id`
  - Enhanced filtering logic to call `loadGradeLevels()` before `loadAllGrades()`
  - Added console logging to debug the filtering process
- **Current Status**: Issue persists - the dropdown still shows "Kinder 2" even though it exists in `curriculum_grade` table
- **Impact**: Users cannot add grade levels due to duplicate prevention on backend
- **Next Steps**: Need to investigate why the frontend filtering is not working despite the fixes applied

## Pending Tasks and Considerations

1. **PRIORITY**: Fix the curriculum grade addition 422 error issue
2. Complete implementation of subject-teacher assignment features
3. Add student enrollment management features
4. Implement comprehensive reporting module
5. Consider adding batch operations for managing multiple records at once
6. Address any remaining performance issues in data loading
7. Enhance caching strategies for better performance
8. Implement offline functionality for core operations

## Technical Notes

### Error Handling Strategy
- Backend: Try-catch blocks with detailed logging and informative error responses
- Frontend: Multilevel error handling with specific user messages
- System-level logging for debugging purposes

### Data Validation
- Backend: Laravel validation rules in controllers
- Frontend: Pre-validation before API calls, with defensive programming

### Performance Considerations
- Cache sensitive data with appropriate TTL (Time-To-Live)
- Implement lazy loading for large data sets
- Use pagination for lists with potentially large numbers of items

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the LAMMS project status, including implemented features, fixes, and pending tasks. The development has focused on creating a robust and user-friendly system for academic management with attention to error handling, data validation, and performance.
