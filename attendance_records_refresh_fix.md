# Attendance Records Refresh Fix

## Problem Solved
User created an attendance session today (Sep 19, 2025) for English in Kinder One, but it wasn't showing up in the Attendance Records page despite being correctly saved in the database.

## Root Cause Identified
- ✅ **Backend API working perfectly**: Returns correct data including today's session
- ❌ **Frontend caching issue**: AttendanceRecordsService has 5-minute cache that was serving old data
- ❌ **No refresh mechanism**: Users had no way to force refresh the data

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Force Refresh Function
```javascript
const forceRefresh = async () => {
    // Clear the service cache
    AttendanceRecordsService.cache.clear();
    
    // Show loading state
    isLoading.value = true;
    
    // Reload attendance records
    await loadAttendanceRecords();
    
    // Show success message
    toast.add({
        severity: 'success',
        summary: 'Refreshed',
        detail: 'Attendance records have been refreshed',
        life: 3000
    });
};
```

### 2. Added Refresh Button
- Added refresh button next to Export button in header
- Button shows "Refresh" with refresh icon
- Disabled during loading states
- Includes tooltip for better UX

### 3. Auto-Clear Cache on Page Load
```javascript
onMounted(() => {
    // Clear cache to ensure fresh data on page load
    AttendanceRecordsService.cache.clear();
    initializeComponent();
});
```

## Features Added
1. **Manual Refresh Button**: Users can click "Refresh" to get latest data
2. **Auto-refresh on Page Load**: Cache is cleared when page loads
3. **Loading States**: Button is disabled during refresh
4. **Success Feedback**: Toast notification confirms refresh
5. **Tooltip**: Helpful tooltip explains button function

## Expected Results
- ✅ Today's English session (Sep 19) should now appear in the attendance records
- ✅ Users can manually refresh data anytime
- ✅ Fresh data loads automatically when page is accessed
- ✅ No more stale cache issues

## Testing
1. Navigate to Attendance Records page
2. Should automatically show fresh data including today's session
3. Click "Refresh" button to manually refresh
4. Verify today's English session appears in the grid

## Files Modified
- `src/views/pages/teacher/TeacherAttendanceRecords.vue`
  - Added `forceRefresh()` function
  - Added refresh button in template
  - Modified `onMounted()` to clear cache
