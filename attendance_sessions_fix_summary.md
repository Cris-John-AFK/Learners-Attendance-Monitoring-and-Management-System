# Attendance Sessions Global Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Maria Santos was seeing attendance sessions from other teachers (Rosa Garcia's sessions from Kinder Two) instead of only her own assigned sections (Kinder One).

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Backend API Filter Issue (FIXED)
- **File**: `lamms-backend/app/Http/Controllers/API/AttendanceSessionController.php`
- **Issue**: API was filtering by `teacher_id` (who created the session) instead of teacher's assigned sections
- **Fix**: Changed to filter by teacher's assigned sections using `teacher_section_subject` table

### 2. Frontend Hardcoded Teacher ID Issue (FIXED)
- **File**: `src/views/pages/teacher/TeacherAttendanceSessions.vue`
- **Issue**: Teacher ID was hardcoded to `3` (Rosa Garcia) instead of getting the actual logged-in teacher
- **Fix**: Added authentication check and dynamic teacher ID retrieval

## Changes Made

### Backend Fix (AttendanceSessionController.php)
```php
// OLD: Filter by who created the session
->where('teacher_id', $teacherId)

// NEW: Filter by teacher's assigned sections
$assignedSectionIds = DB::table('teacher_section_subject')
    ->where('teacher_id', $teacherId)
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->pluck('section_id')
    ->unique()
    ->toArray();

->whereIn('section_id', $assignedSectionIds)
```

### Frontend Fix (TeacherAttendanceSessions.vue)
1. **Added TeacherAuthService import**
2. **Removed hardcoded teacher ID**: `const teacherId = ref(3)` → `const teacherId = ref(null)`
3. **Added authentication initialization**:
   ```javascript
   const initializeTeacherData = async () => {
       const teacherData = TeacherAuthService.getTeacherData();
       teacherId.value = teacherData.teacher.id;
   }
   ```
4. **Updated onMounted to initialize teacher first**

## Global Impact
✅ **All current and future teachers** will now only see attendance sessions for their assigned sections
✅ **Maria Santos** will only see Kinder One sessions
✅ **Rosa Garcia** will only see Kinder One and Kinder Two sessions (her assigned sections)
✅ **Any new teacher** will automatically follow the same filtering rules

## Expected Results
- Maria Santos should now see only sessions for Kinder One
- The English session she created should be visible
- No more Kinder Two sessions should appear for Maria Santos
- Each teacher will only see sessions for sections they are assigned to teach

## Testing
The fix has been tested with both Maria Santos (Teacher 1) and Rosa Garcia (Teacher 3) and confirmed working correctly via API calls.
