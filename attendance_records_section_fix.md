# Attendance Records Section Access Fix

## Problem Identified
Rosa Garcia (Teacher 3) could only see **Kinder Two** in the section dropdown, but she should see **both Kinder One and Kinder Two** since she teaches in both sections.

## Root Cause
The `AttendanceRecordsService.getTeacherHomeroomSections()` method was filtering to show only **homeroom sections** (where teacher is homeroom_teacher_id), but teachers should see **all sections they teach in**.

## Rosa Garcia's Assignments
- **Kinder Two** (Homeroom): English, Filipino, Science
- **Kinder One** (Teaching): Filipino

## Solution Implemented

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// Filter to only homeroom sections (where teacher is homeroom_teacher_id)
const homeroomSections = allSections.filter(section => 
    section.homeroom_teacher_id === parseInt(teacherId)
);
```
**Result**: Rosa only saw Kinder Two (her homeroom)

### After Fix:
```javascript
// Transform assignments directly into sections format
// Each assignment already contains section info and subjects
const sectionsWithSubjects = assignments.map(assignment => {
    return {
        id: assignment.section_id,
        name: assignment.section_name,
        subjects: assignment.subjects || []
    };
});
```
**Result**: Rosa sees both Kinder One and Kinder Two (all her assigned sections)

## Expected Results After Fix

### Section Dropdown Options for Rosa:
- ✅ **Kinder Two** (her homeroom)
- ✅ **Kinder One** (where she teaches Filipino)

### Attendance Data Rosa Should See:

**When viewing Kinder One:**
- ✅ **Sep 19**: English session (created by Maria Santos)
- ✅ **Sep 17**: Filipino sessions

**When viewing Kinder Two:**
- ✅ **Sep 17**: Filipino sessions

## Files Modified
- `src/services/AttendanceRecordsService.js`
  - Modified `getTeacherHomeroomSections()` method
  - Changed from homeroom-only filter to all-assigned-sections
  - Updated cache key and method comments

## Testing Steps
1. **Login as Rosa Garcia** (Teacher 3)
2. **Navigate to Attendance Records**
3. **Check Section dropdown** - should show both Kinder One and Kinder Two
4. **Select Kinder One** - should show Sep 19 English session
5. **Select Kinder Two** - should show Sep 17 Filipino sessions

## Global Impact
✅ **All teachers** will now see attendance records for **all sections they teach in**, not just their homeroom sections
✅ **More comprehensive attendance tracking** across all teacher assignments
✅ **Better visibility** into student attendance across subjects
