# Force Refresh Fix for Attendance Records

## Problem Identified
- ✅ Backend API is working correctly and returning today's session (Session 5 - English - 2025-09-19)
- ❌ Frontend is not showing today's data (showing cached/old data)

## Root Cause
The frontend `TeacherAttendanceRecords.vue` is not refreshing after new attendance sessions are created.

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
2. Or press `F12` → Network tab → Check "Disable cache"
3. Refresh the page

### Solution 2: Force Component Refresh
Add a refresh button or auto-refresh mechanism to the attendance records page.

### Solution 3: Clear Service Cache
The `AttendanceRecordsService` has a 5-minute cache. The cache might be serving old data.

## Immediate Fix Needed
Add a "Refresh" button to the TeacherAttendanceRecords.vue page that:
1. Clears the service cache
2. Reloads the attendance data
3. Forces component re-render

## API Verification
✅ API endpoint works: `/api/attendance-records/section/1?start_date=2025-09-01&end_date=2025-09-19`
✅ Returns correct data including today's English session
✅ Backend is functioning perfectly

The issue is purely frontend caching/refresh related.
