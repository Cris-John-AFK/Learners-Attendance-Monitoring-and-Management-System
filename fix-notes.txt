Linting Error Analysis:

The linting error "openAssignHomeRoomTeacherDialog is declared but its value is never read" indicates there's a function defined in the code that's not being used anywhere.

After examining the Curriculum.vue file, we found:
1. There are two similar functions:
   - openHomeRoomTeacherDialog (line ~2445) - This is actively used in the template
   - openAssignHomeRoomTeacherDialog (somewhere in the file) - This appears to be unused

2. The assignHomeRoomTeacher function (modified in previous edits) is working correctly and is properly called when the user clicks the "Assign" button in the homeroom teacher dialog.

Fix options:
1. Remove the unused openAssignHomeRoomTeacherDialog function
2. If the openAssignHomeRoomTeacherDialog function is needed for backward compatibility, add a reference in the openHomeRoomTeacherDialog function like:
   ```
   // For backward compatibility
   const openAssignHomeRoomTeacherDialog = openHomeRoomTeacherDialog;
   ```

The main issue reported by the user is the 500 Internal Server Error when trying to assign a homeroom teacher. This was addressed in the previous edits by ensuring a clean numeric teacher_id is sent in the payload.
